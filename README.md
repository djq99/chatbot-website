# Chatbot Website

A responsive website built with React that showcases:
- A navbar with a logo and a search bar.
- A side menu with two pages ("Apps" and "Documents"), each containing scrollable text.
- A chatbot interface that opens from the bottom right.

## Features

1. **Navbar:**
   - Logo on the left.
   - Search bar on the right that filters paragraphs in the content area and highlights matching text.

2. **Side Menu:**
   - Allows switching between "Apps" and "Documents" pages.
   - Each page has multiple paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum text.

3. **Chatbot:**
   - An icon button at the bottom right corner opens a chat window.
   - Chat window dimensions: 400x600 on desktop, full screen on mobile.
   - A timer in the header shows elapsed time since opening (in seconds).
   - "Reset" clears the chat history and resets the timer.
   - "Close" closes the chat window (also resetting the timer).
   - User messages align right; bot messages align left.
   - Messages sent via the enter key or a send button.
